Project submission for Hackanovate2.0-2020

The name of the project is 'Smart Railway Ticket Generation and Authentication System'.

At the time of boarding the train, the passenger has to get the QR code and fingerprint scanned(using the same app and biometric scanner), which will send a signal to the arduino(connected to the app via bluetooth) to open the coach gates. The name of the android app is 'Smart Railway QR'.
